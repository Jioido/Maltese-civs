    "startIntroPart1": "Blessings upon you, noble Priest Saverio Cassar, guardian and leader of Gozo, land of resilience and faith. Through centuries, Gozo has stood against conquerors and storms alike, a peaceful land known for its fortified cities and fishing villages. During the rebellions of 1798, you rose Gozo as a self-governing state, an island that refused to welcome the French invasion. It was only the meaddling British forces that brought down our plans, and disapproved of an independent Gozo.",
